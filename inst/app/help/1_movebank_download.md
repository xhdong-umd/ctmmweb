### Limitations
The Movebank interface in app used Movebank API, which has some limitations compare to the Movebank website:
- The studies with data visible returned from API are not as accurate. It's quite possible some studies don't have data to view or download.
- The downloaded data only have some core columns, not as complete as the csv downloaded from Movebank website.

### Table of all studies
- In all Movebank studies, only a part of them have data visible to your account. Only these studies are listed.
- The columns of `deployments`, `events` or `individuals` are obsolete and only kept for reference, do not rely on them. 

### Selected study detail
- After you click on a study in the table, the detail of that study will be downloaded and displayed here.
- You can click `Download`, then scroll to the data preview box for result.
	- Success download will have a notification and have the data previewed.
	- Sometimes the response is a page saying once you agree the license term the data can be downloaded. You can open the study pages by clicking to the button `open in Movebank`, then download from there.
		+ There could be a pop up window asking to agree the license terms. After one time agreement you can download from Movebank or from the app later.
		+ It's also possible there is actually no data available for download.   

### Save and import data
- You can save the downloaded data as csv file, or import it for next step of analysis.
- The data downloaded with Movebank API only have core columns included by default. 
- You can use `open in Movebank` to download from website if you need more attributes or more filter options.
